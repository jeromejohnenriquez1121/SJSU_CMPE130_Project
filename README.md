# SJSU_CMPE130_Project

Abstract of the Project:

In our project, we developed a desktop application, Classroomverse, that can help teachers manage important classroom information such 
as managing students’ grades and alphabetting students’ names by an ID number system. The program is built in Python because it is easier
to implement our sorting algorithm and data structure with the pseudo code our professor has provided for the sorting algorithms. There
are two main topics that we incorporated in our project: Quick Sort and Hash Table.

Instructions on how to run our CMPE130 project, Classroomverse:

1. Install Python.
Visit the link: https://www.python.org/. Then, go to Downloads. Python is available on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Please
install the v3 of Python as our code follows that version.

2. Install a Python IDE.
You can use Microsoft Visual Studio and download the Python Development libraries for it. You can also use Jetbrain's PyCharm which as
Python development libraries integrated. Either IDE is good to use.
